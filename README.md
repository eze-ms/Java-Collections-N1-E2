# Java Collections - Reverse List App

## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates the use of Java Collections to manipulate lists and reverse their order using `ListIterator`. The program creates a list of integers, populates it, and then generates a second list with the elements of the first in reverse order.

### Functionality
1. **List Creation:**
   - A `List<Integer>` is populated with sample integer values.
2. **Reverse Operation:**
   - A `ListIterator` is used to traverse the first list in reverse order and populate a second list with these reversed elements.
3. **Output:**
   - Prints the original list and the reversed list to the console.
